Tested the response time between the action of sending new sensor data to the receiver from a mat,
and receiving and processing said data.
client:   ESP32 doit devkit v1
server:   ESP32 doit devkit v1

Upon sending sensor data, the mat sets a pin to high to notify the oscilloscope that the data has been send.
The receiver does the same once it receives that data.

Conclusion:
The response time is 50ms which is slower than specified in the requirements.
Unfortunatly being stuck with NimBLE or BLE libraries  it is not possible to change the BLE stack to improve this.

Actions:
Test the same setup with multiple connection (max 8 mats)
Test influence of faster input
See which improvements could be made to the ESP32 firmware (i.e. clock speed)
Test the same setup with a newer ESP32 board (i.e. ESP32-S3 devkit)
