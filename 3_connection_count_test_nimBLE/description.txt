Test to check how many mats can be connected to 1 reciever and if it is stable
Receiver:   ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1
Mat:        ESP32 DOIT devkit v1
            ESP32-DevKitm-1 v1.0

8 ESP32's have firmware which simulates a mat, each sends a new sensor value packet every 250 ms
1 ESP32-S3 is setup as a receiver and sends its data and state to a serial port

This test is to see if the BLE stack handle mulitple connections and if it is stable.
A nice extra which was tested during testing was how the receiver and mats handled connections 
and disconnection routines.

Conclusion:
The BLE stack held up, although it crashed during 1 disconnect, this is expected to be due
to a bug which causes multiple mats to connect to the same client channel. 
This bug also causes multiple mats to stack on top of eachother, causing the reading to be incorrect
thinking a sensor value belongs to a mat with a different ID.

One more important note is that the receiver ESP became relatively hot, either cooling is required or
this could be reduced by changing BLE settings.

To Do:
Test max baudrate with multiple connected mats.
Fix assigned client bug
